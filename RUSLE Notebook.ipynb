    "# Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Soil erosion poses a growing threat to global food security, with up to 40% of the world’s topsoil already degraded — a figure projected to rise to 90% by 2050 (UNCCD, 2022). As population growth intensifies land pressure, the ability to model and manage soil loss becomes critical. The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) is a widely adopted empirical model for estimating average annual soil erosion caused by rainfall and surface runoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a GIS-based RUSLE workflow in Python using open-source libraries. Each factor in the RUSLE equation is calculated separately and transparently:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "A = R × K × LS × C × P\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- *A* = annual soil loss (tonnes/hectare/year)\n",
    "- *R* = rainfall erosivity\n",
    "- *K* = soil erodibility\n",
    "- *LS* = slope length and steepness\n",
    "- *C* = cover management\n",
    "- *P* = support practices\n",
    "\n",
    "## Calculating R\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial data for R comes from the Centre for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA) (https://data.ceda.ac.uk/badc/ukmo-midas-open/data/uk-daily-rain-obs), in this example rainfall point data data for the six counties Northern Ireland was used."
